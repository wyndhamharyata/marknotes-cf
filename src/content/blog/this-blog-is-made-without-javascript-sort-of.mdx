# Hello world!

This blog is 100% made without javascript code (sort of).

I made it using **HTMX + Golang + Tailwind CSS**, including this very blogpost. Behind locked door, there is pretty fancy markdown parser done in the backend in real time. You won't see it though, which is a shame :')

See you in other articles in this blog!

### Thank you!
